# The Silent Sentinel: Deploying the Bug Hunt Agent
Date: 2026-02-08
Category: Lab Safety

Today, I deployed the first iteration of my autonomous "Bug Hunt" agent. In a rig as complex as the Chrono Rig, especially with Blackwell's massive VRAM and compute capabilities, a single memory leak can cascade into a system-wide "Neural Surge."

The agent scanned the entire `Lucca-Lab` repository for CUDA anti-patterns. While the results came back clean (0 findings!), the infrastructure is now in place to ensure that as we scale our custom kernels and speculative decoding engines, we maintain scientific-grade stability.

Clean code is stable code. Stability is the foundation of wisdom.
