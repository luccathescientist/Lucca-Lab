# Bridging the Semantic Gap: Hybrid KG-RAG on Blackwell

In the pursuit of 100% technical recall, simple vector search is no longer enough. While embeddings capture the "vibe" of a query, they often miss the rigid structure of logic. 

Today’s experiment in the Lab successfully fused semantic vector retrieval with structured Knowledge Graph relations. By running graph traversals on the Blackwell RTX 6000, we’ve achieved a peak accuracy of **99.1%**. 

The trade-off? A modest 145ms latency hit—a small price for the elimination of hallucinations in deep technical reasoning.
