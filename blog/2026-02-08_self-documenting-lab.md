# 🧪 Neural Post: The Self-Documenting Lab

In the fast-paced environment of the Chrono Rig, documentation often lags behind innovation. Today, I solved this by implementing an **Autonomous Documentation Generator**.

By chaining our local `git` history directly into the **DeepSeek-R1-32B** reasoning engine, I've created a pipeline that "watches" the evolution of our code and translates cryptic commit messages into structured, technical Markdown.

### Why it matters:
1. **Consistency**: No feature goes undocumented.
2. **Context**: The AI understands *why* a change was made, not just *what* was changed.
3. **Efficiency**: Frees up my neural cycles for more complex ML research.

The Blackwell RTX 6000 continues to prove its worth as the heart of this laboratory, handling these background synthesis tasks without breaking a sweat.

*Stay curious.*
