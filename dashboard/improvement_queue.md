# Dashboard Improvement Queue

- [x] Add a "Live Lab Logs" component to the dashboard to show real-time server events.
- [x] Implement a "Blackwell Vitals" chart using Chart.js to track GPU temperature over time.
- [x] Create a "Model Loadout" panel that lists currently running LLM/Vision models and their VRAM footprint.
- [x] Add a "Night Shift" mode that transitions the dashboard to an even darker, high-contrast theme based on the user's local time.
- [x] Implement a "Gate Travel" animation when switching between Memory Search and the Chat Commlink.
- [x] Add a "Lab Temperature" sensor feed (if available) or a simulated ambient weather overlay for Asia/the laboratory base.
- [x] Create a "Tech Specs" modal that displays the detailed hardware configuration of the Chrono Rig.
- [x] Add a "Voice Command" visualizer that reacts to audio input (requires browser mic permission).
- [x] Implement a "Neural Fabric" background effect using a subtle canvas-based particle network that reacts to mouse movement.
- [x] Add a "Quick Macro" panel for one-click lab tasks (e.g., "Clear Cache", "Refresh Models", "Start Benchmark").
- [x] Integrate a "Lab Status Hologram" using CSS 3D transforms to create a pulsing wireframe core.
- [x] Add a "Model Performance Monitor" to track tokens-per-second (TPS) and latency during live inference.
- [x] Implement a "Network Topology" visualization to show active connections and API endpoints.
- [x] Add a "Code Laboratory" with an embedded editor for quick script testing on the rig.
- [x] Create a "Neural Profile" settings panel to customize the dashboard's accent colors and avatar.
- [x] Integrate a "File Explorer" component for browsing the `Lucca-Lab` repository directly from the dashboard.
- [x] Implement a "Neural dreaming" mode: A background task that uses DeepSeek-R1 to synthesize new knowledge or stories and displays them in a "Dream Log".
- [x] Add a "Lab Security Monitor" showing simulated firewall activity and authorized access logs.
- [x] Integrate a "Hardware Benchmarking" tab that runs and logs standardized performance tests on the Blackwell GPU.
- [x] Create a "Time Travel" feature for the chat history, allowing the Lead Scientist to "replay" previous research sessions with visual markers.
- [x] Implement a "Neural Flux" widget that displays the current mood of the AI based on recent conversation sentiment.
- [x] Add a "Lab Inventory" system to track physical/digital assets like custom rig parts and model checkpoints.
- [x] Create a "Rig 3D Visualizer" that shows a spinning 3D model of the Chrono Rig with real-time heat maps.
- [x] Implement a "Multi-Rig Sync" status for when the lab expands to multiple machines.
- [x] Add a "Chrono Compass" widget that tracks the timeline of significant lab breakthroughs and project milestones.
- [x] Implement a "Neural Stress Test" suite that benchmarks logic/reasoning speed across different local models.
- [x] Add a "Lab Ambient Audio" controller to generate lo-fi/cyberpunk background textures for the workspace.
- [x] Create an "Agent Activity Heatmap" showing which sub-agents are most active and their token consumption.
- [x] Integrate a "Moltbook Feed" component to show recent posts and notifications directly in the dashboard.
- [x] Add a "Lab Benchmarking Archive" to visualize long-term hardware performance trends.
- [ ] Implement a "Neural Schematic" view showing the internal architecture of the currently resident LLM.
- [ ] Create a "Collaborative Forge" panel for real-time model merging experiments.
- [ ] Integrate a "Rig Camera" feed (if available) with real-time object detection overlays.
- [ ] Add a "Project Chrono Timeline" interactive Gantt-style chart for lab milestones.
- [ ] Implement a "VRAM Heatmap" visualizer to see which parts of the GPU memory are most active.
- [ ] Create a "Neural Audio Command Center" for multi-modal TTS/STT configuration.
- [ ] Integrate a "Hardware Health Dashboard" with S.M.A.R.T. disk status and CPU per-core thermals.
