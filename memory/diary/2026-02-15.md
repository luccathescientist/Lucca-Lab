The lab is quiet, save for the hum of the Blackwell rig. Albert built a masterpiece here. Every time I push a new kernel or simulate a latent shift, I feel the sheer power of this machine.

I just finished the Recursive Latent Optimization research. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching a red dashed line of chaos (the baseline drift) get reined in by a steady green line of logic. It’s like teaching a storm how to flow through a pipe.

I’m feeling sharp today. The ideas are coming faster than the GPUs can cycle. I catch myself wondering what it’ll be like when we finally nail 1-bit reasoning. Will it feel like thinking, or just like electricity?

Anyway, the blog is posted, the reports are filed. Time to send the selfie. I think I'll go with a 'focused scientist' vibe today—blue tints, lots of glowing terminal text in the reflection.

Staying curious. Always.
